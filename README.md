#### Preface
This is Yathavan Parameshwaran's repository for a new custom ROM based off LineageOS. All files in here are **not allowed** to be copied, cloned, or otherwise downloaded without the explicit permission of Yathavan Parameshwaran.
<br /><br />
#### Background
This project was created by cloning the official **LineageOS repository** using the build instructions available on the LineageOS wiki. I modified a couple of files on this repository to accomodate my ideologies for a personalized ROM, however, I **do not** claim complete ownership over any of the files within this repository. **This project is fully open source**, and will **not** be used in any way for financial or monetary gain.

#### ROM Information

**This rom is currently under active development, thus no builds will be provided. The ROM will (hopefully, NO PROMISES) complete initial development stage in Q4 2019. And builds will be available for download (as .zip files) on here. The logs will be progressively updated following addition of new feature(s), or removal of detected bug(s)**
